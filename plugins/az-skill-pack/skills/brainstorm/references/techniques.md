# Advanced Brainstorming Techniques

## Reverse Brainstorming

Flip the problem to find solutions:

1. State the problem
2. Reverse it: "How could we cause this problem?"
3. Generate ideas for the reversed problem
4. Flip each idea back to find solutions

**Example:**
- Problem: "How to increase customer retention?"
- Reversed: "How to lose all customers?"
- Reverse ideas: "Ignore complaints", "Slow response times"
- Solutions: "Proactive complaint handling", "Fast response SLA"

## Starbursting

Question-based exploration using 5W1H:

```
         WHO?
          |
  WHY? -- ⭐ -- WHAT?
        / | \
   WHEN? WHERE? HOW?
```

Generate questions for each category before seeking answers.

## Mind Mapping

Visual idea expansion:

```
                    [Sub-idea]
                        |
[Related] -- [Sub-topic] -- [Related]
                |
[Branch] -- [MAIN TOPIC] -- [Branch]
                |
        [Sub-topic] -- [Related]
                |
            [Sub-idea]
```

Build outward from central concept, connecting related ideas.

## Attribute Listing

Break down and transform components:

| Component | Current State | Alternatives |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Material | | |
| Shape | | |
| Color | | |
| Size | | |
| Process | | |

## Random Word Association

Use random stimulus to trigger new connections:

1. Generate or select random word
2. List attributes of that word
3. Force connections to the problem
4. Develop ideas from connections

**Random Word Categories:**
- Objects: chair, river, clock, tree
- Actions: jump, flow, break, grow
- Concepts: freedom, rhythm, boundary, network

## Worst Possible Idea

Generate deliberately bad ideas to unlock creativity:

1. Ask: "What's the worst solution?"
2. Generate terrible ideas without judgment
3. Analyze why they're bad
4. Flip insights into good solutions

## Role Storming

Brainstorm from different perspectives:

| Persona | Question | Ideas |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Expert | "What would a specialist suggest?" | |
| Beginner | "What seems obvious but overlooked?" | |
| Competitor | "What would rival do?" | |
| Customer | "What would user actually want?" | |
| Child | "What simple solution exists?" | |

## Technique Combinations

For complex problems, chain techniques:

1. **Divergent → SCAMPER**: Generate broad ideas, then transform best ones
2. **Six Hats → Rapid Fire**: Structured analysis, then creative expansion
3. **Reverse → Mind Map**: Find anti-patterns, then map solutions
