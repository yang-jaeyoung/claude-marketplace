# Brainstorm Skill

Generate diverse, creative ideas through structured brainstorming techniques.

## Core Workflow

1. **Clarify the topic** - Understand what the user wants to brainstorm about
2. **Select technique** - Choose appropriate brainstorming method based on context
3. **Generate ideas** - Apply technique to produce diverse options
4. **Organize output** - Present ideas in a clear, actionable format

## Brainstorming Techniques

### 1. Divergent Expansion (Default)

Generate ideas across multiple categories:

```
Topic: [User's topic]

🎯 Direct Solutions
- [idea 1]
- [idea 2]

🔄 Alternative Approaches  
- [idea 3]
- [idea 4]

💡 Creative/Unconventional
- [idea 5]
- [idea 6]

🔗 Combinations & Hybrids
- [idea 7]
- [idea 8]
```

### 2. SCAMPER Method

Apply transformations systematically:

| Action | Question | Ideas |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **S**ubstitute | What can be replaced? | |
| **C**ombine | What can merge together? | |
| **A**dapt | What can be modified from elsewhere? | |
| **M**odify | What can be changed/enlarged/reduced? | |
| **P**ut to other uses | What else could this be used for? | |
| **E**liminate | What can be removed? | |
| **R**everse | What can be inverted/rearranged? | |

### 3. Six Thinking Hats

Explore from multiple perspectives:

| Hat | Focus | Ideas |
|-----|-------|-------|
| ⚪ White | Facts & Data | |
| 🔴 Red | Emotions & Intuition | |
| ⚫ Black | Risks & Cautions | |
| 🟡 Yellow | Benefits & Optimism | |
| 🟢 Green | Creativity & Alternatives | |
| 🔵 Blue | Process & Summary | |

### 4. Rapid Fire (Quantity Focus)

Generate maximum ideas quickly without filtering:
- Aim for 15-20+ ideas
- No criticism during generation
- Wild ideas welcome
- Build on previous ideas

## Output Guidelines

- **Quantity over quality initially** - Generate many ideas before evaluating
- **Visual organization** - Use tables, categories, or mind-map style formatting
- **Actionable format** - Make ideas concrete and implementable
- **Follow-up suggestions** - Offer to expand on promising ideas
